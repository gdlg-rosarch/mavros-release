ros-hydro-libmavconn (0.8.5-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Fix libmavconn include destination.
    Before that change headers installed in include/libmavconn (package name)
    and it broke release builds for 0.9.1 and 0.8.4.
    Strange that prerelease build runs without errors.
    Issue #162 <https://github.com/vooon/mavros/issues/162>.
